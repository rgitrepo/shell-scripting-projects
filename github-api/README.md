# GitHub Repository Collaborators Reader

This Bash script interfaces with the GitHub API to list users who have read access to a specified GitHub repository. It demonstrates a straightforward, script-based approach to authenticate with the GitHub API, make GET requests, and process JSON data to extract and display specific information.

## Features

- Authenticate with the GitHub API using a personal access token.
- Fetch the list of collaborators for a specified repository.
- Filter collaborators with read access (pull access).
- Display usernames of collaborators with read access.

## Requirements

- **Bash**: A Unix shell and command language, available by default on most Linux and macOS systems, and available for installation on Windows through various environments (e.g., Git Bash, WSL).
- **curl**: Command-line tool and library for transferring data with URLs. curl is pre-installed on many Unix-like operating systems and can be installed on Windows.
- **jq**: Lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. `jq` needs to be installed separately if not already available on your system.

## Setup

Before running the script, ensure you have the necessary credentials:

1. **GitHub Username**: Your GitHub username.
2. **Personal Access Token**: A GitHub personal access token with appropriate scopes for reading repository information. Generate this token in your GitHub account settings under "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens".

## Usage

1. **Set Credentials**: Edit the script to include your GitHub username and personal access token:

    ```bash
    USERNAME="your_github_username"
    TOKEN="your_personal_access_token"
   ```

For enhancing security and avoiding hardcoding sensitive information like the GitHub username and personal access token within the script, it's recommended to export these values as environment variables in your terminal session. Here's how you can adjust the script accordingly:

### Setting Up Environment Variables

Before running the script, you need to export your GitHub username and personal access token as environment variables. This can be done directly in your terminal session. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
export username=YourGitHubUsername
export token=YourGitHubPersonalAccessToken
```

Replace `YourGitHubUsername` and `YourGitHubPersonalAccessToken` with your actual GitHub username and personal access token.

### Security Note

Exporting these variables in your terminal session is more secure than hardcoding them in the script because:

- The values are not stored in the script file, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.
- Environment variables are specific to the terminal session and are not exposed to other users or processes on the system.

Ensure that you do not expose your personal access token or username in shared scripts or version control systems to keep your GitHub account secure.


2. **Run the Script**: Provide the repository owner and repository name as arguments:

    ```bash
    ./script_name.sh repository_owner repository_name
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    ./script_name.sh octocat Hello-World
    ```

3. **View Results**: The script will list the usernames of users with read access to the specified repository.

## How It Works 

- The script defines a base GitHub API URL and sets up authentication using the provided username and personal access token.
- It defines a function, `github_api_get`, to make authenticated GET requests to a specified GitHub API endpoint.
- Another function, `list_users_with_read_access`, constructs the appropriate endpoint to access repository collaborators and uses `github_api_get` to fetch the data. It then processes the JSON response with `jq` to list the usernames of collaborators with read access.
- The main part of the script invokes `list_users_with_read_access`, displaying the list of relevant usernames.

## Note

- Ensure your personal access token has the `repo` scope to access private repositories. For public repositories, fewer scopes may be required.
- This script does not handle pagination; for repositories with many collaborators, modifications may be necessary to iterate over all pages of results.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Please ensure any pull requests adhere to the following:

- Keep changes concise and relevant to the functionalities of the script.
- Update this README if adding new features or changing the setup instructions.
